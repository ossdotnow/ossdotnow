## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.2.13 or higher
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local PostgreSQL and Redis)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ossdotnow/ossdotnow.git
   cd ossdotnow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Make a copy of `.env.example` and replace values with your own.

4. **Start the database services**

   ```bash
   bun docker:up
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   bun db:migrate
   ```

6. **Seed the database (optional)**

   ```bash
   bun db:seed
   ```

7. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📝 Available Scripts

### Development

- `bun dev` - Start the development server with hot reload
- `bun build` - Build the application for production
- `bun start` - Start the production server

### Database

- `bun docker:up` - Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
- `bun docker:down` - Stop the containers
- `bun docker:clean` - Stop containers and remove volumes
- `bun db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `bun db:migrate` - Apply database migrations
- `bun db:push` - Push schema changes directly (development only)
- `bun db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio for database management
- `bun db:seed` - Seed the database with sample data
- `bun db:make-all-admin` - Grant admin privileges to all users (development only)

### Code Quality

- `bun lint` - Run ESLint
- `bun format` - Format code with Prettier
- `bun typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

## 🔐 Setting up OAuth Providers

### GitHub OAuth

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click "New OAuth App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - Application name: `oss.now (Development)`
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### GitLab OAuth

1. Go to [GitLab Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications)
2. Create a new application with the following:
   - Name: `oss.now (Development)`
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/gitlab`
   - Scopes: `api`, `read_api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`, `openid`, `profile`, `email`
3. Copy the Application ID (Client ID) and Secret to your `.env` file

## 🤝 Contributing

We love contributions! Please read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about our development process, how to propose bug fixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes.

### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `dev` (not `main`)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and ensure code quality
   ```bash
   bun lint
   bun typecheck
   ```
5. Commit your changes with descriptive messages
6. Push to your fork and create a Pull Request

### Important Notes

- Always branch off from `dev`, not `main`
- Make sure no other Next.js apps are running locally as it may interfere with OAuth flows
- The application is currently in development mode on production to prevent public access

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on Vercel:

1. Fork this repository
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

For production deployments, ensure you:

- Update OAuth callback URLs to your production domain
- Use production database and Redis instances
- Set `VERCEL_ENV=production`

## 📚 Architecture

### Frontend

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- **React 19** for UI components
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for consistent UI components

### Backend

- **tRPC** for type-safe API endpoints
- **DrizzleORM** for database queries and migrations
- **Better-Auth** for authentication
- **Upstash Redis** for rate limiting

### Database Schema

- Users and authentication tables
- Projects with categories and metadata
- Submissions and waitlist
- Project launches and comments
- Voting and reporting systems

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OAuth redirect issues**
   - Ensure no other Next.js apps are running on port 3000
   - Check that callback URLs match exactly

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Make sure Docker is running
   - Check that PostgreSQL is accessible on port 5432
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

3. **Environment variable errors**
   - All required variables must be set
   - Run `bun dev` to see validation errors
